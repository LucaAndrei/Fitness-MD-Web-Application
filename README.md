# FitnessMD
Web application built with MeteorJS.

This project was built for my Master's Degree Thesis at Universitatea "Dunarea de Jos" Galati, Romania.

The scope of the project was to build a pedometer using an Arduino Board which connected through Bluetooth to an Android device.
The Android device would send the data received from the Arduino to a database stored in the cloud.
All the data from the database was then displayed in a Web Application.

Besides counting steps, the Android application would also send the user with personalised activity routines or plan meals based on the user's goals.
Through the web application the user could register for public sport activities made throughout the city.
